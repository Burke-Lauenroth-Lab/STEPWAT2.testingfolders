# Mortflags input definition file STEPPEWAT
# to control output quantities etc.

# Anything after the first pound sign is a comment
# Blank lines, white space, and comments may be used freely,
# however, the order of input is important
# This file outputs the number of individuals killed by resource
# group and species (if specified) by age class (how old they were).
# It is not how many individuals were killed in each year of the simulation.
# Instead, this file summarizes how many individuals were killed at 1 year old,
# 2 years old, etc. However, the number of rows in this output files corresponds
# to how many years the simulation was run. Do not let this confuse you.
# Estabs (first row of output) is the number of individuals that got
# established across all years of the simulation.

# sumry yearly head  sep   group  species
  y       y       y    t     y     y


#===================================================
# The input line is a set of yes/no flags that define
# whether that parameter will be output, except for
# the separator character.  For the flags, 'y' or 'yes'
# (upper or lower case) indicates true. Anything else
# (other than nothing) indicates false; ie, there must
# be at least a place holder.
#
# sumry == y if mortality data summary to be output, 
#     == n if mortality data summary not to be output. If 'n' then
#     the rest of the flags are not processed.
#      
# yearly == if 'n', suppress printing yearly results.
#          important if you've specified many iterations.
#          if 'y', each output file contains a full run
#          of the model with the iteration number as part
#          of the filename.
# head == output a line of field names as the first line of
#      the output file.  Affects both yearly and summary output.
# sep == specify one of the following as a separator
#       t = tab, s = space, or any single character
#       such as , | : etc (excluding '#','t', and 's').
#
# group == y if group level output desired
#
# species == y if species-level output desired
#
#===================================================================
# Suggested future output.  Categories of output are written to
# separate files. Preceed each entry with a hash mark # to turn it
# off.  Items in a group without a filename are written as a separate
# column in the last-specified file.
#
# all output is one or two columns preceeded by Iter, Year, Spp
#
# Estab(1) - number of indivs of spp established this year

#ESTAB estabs/estabs.out  # number indivs of spp estab this year
#MortAll   mort/kills.out
#MortIntrin    mort/intrin.out #
#MortNoRes     #output goes in intrin.out if none specified here
