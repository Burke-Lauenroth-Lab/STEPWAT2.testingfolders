#Production Coefficients for STEPWAT

# These values are used to convert yearly biomass
# from STEPPE to monthly production values for SOILWAT

# LITTER - use the maximum value from the converted biomass 
#          to multiply by this number to compute a litter 
#          value in g/m^2.  Needn't sum to 1.0.
# BMASS -  STEPPE's yearly vals are converted to monthly.
# PCT_LIVE - RGroups pct live each month is used to calc
#            VegProdTypes pct live for soilwat.

# BMASS
# This is the percent of yearly biomass that each month has
# Example of how Grass (bouteloua,p.graminoids,a.gram/shrub) biomass is calculated

# PCTLive
# Proportion of Biomass that is actually living (0-1) for each month for each RGroup
# This table is used to calculate the %Live for SoilWat. The %Live for each VegType group is the weighted average of the Groups in the vegtype by
# their fraction of biomass. For example bouteloua, p.graminoids, and a.gram/shrub are in the same group. If they had biomass 150,50,10 respectively.
# July the Grass %Live value would be .40 * (150/210) + .40 * (50/210) + .40 * (10/210) = .40
# 
# First column is the group name as defined in the 
# group parameters file for STEPPE.  The name must be
# spelled exactly the same.
