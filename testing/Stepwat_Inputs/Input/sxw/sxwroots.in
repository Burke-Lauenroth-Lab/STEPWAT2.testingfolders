# Rooting distributions for STEPWAT
# Distributions must sum to one for each group
# Be sure these data are consistent with the SOILWAT
# layer definitions for transpiration (i.e. number of layers
# that roots occupy must match the number of soil layers where
# transpiration occurs in soils_v23.in)
